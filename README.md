# Weather_Dashboard_HW

For this assignment, the goal was to create a working weather dashboard that would not only display the current day forecast but provide a five day forecast as well. Using the openweather api, I was able to pull the current weather informaiton and display it on the html.

After some work, I managed to get the five forecast working as well. The biggest issue was dealing with a large amount of white space inside the main weather display.

Users can search for any city in the world and get the most update to date information regarding the weather, temp, wind speed and humidity in the surrounding arena.
