Using the Weather Dashboard, users can look up the current forecast of any given city as well as a five-day forecast below. Users will be able to view the current temperature in fahrenheit, current humidity levels, wind speed and ultra-violet index.

After selecting a city, the user will be able to view any past searches on the left side of the screen underneth the search bar.

This app uses the OpenWeather API to determine all the weather information that is displayed on each card on the screen. The app is also responsive on most mobile devices.
